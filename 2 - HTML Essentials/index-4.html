<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph that contains only one sentence</p>
<p><u>Important Note:</u>&nbsp;<b>HTML is for content, not for styling!</b></p>
<p> BTW - I'm using the following tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows as my operating system</li>
  <li>WSL (Windows Subsystem for Windows) as my coding environment (Ubuntu 20.04)</li>
  <li>Visual Studio code as my IDE</li>
  <li>Live Server Extension in order to write code and see the changes on the fly.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've also set up git and connected it to a repository in order to track anything I do throughout the course...</p>
<p>In addition, I'm using the Git Lens extension!</p>
<p>The above list consists of a <code>li</code> element nested inside a <code>ul</code> element</p>

<h2>See you around, World</h2>
